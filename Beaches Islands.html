                Little Andaman Island, the fourth-largest island in the Andaman archipelago, lies about 120 km south of Port Blair, nestled at the southern tip and covering roughly 707 km². Hut Bay (Kwate‑tu‑Kwage) is the primary settlement and harbor, offering boat and air connections to Port Blair.Renowned for its pristine beaches like Butler Bay—India’s premier surfing spot with golden sand and consistent waves—and Netaji Nagar nestled under coconut palms, the island is a haven for beach lovers.The interior rainforest hosts two stunning cascades: White Surf (6.5 km trek) and Whisper Wave (about 20–25 km trek), both offering refreshing plunge pools.Wildlife enthusiasts can explore mangrove-lined creek boating to spot marine birds and turtles; elephant safaris and exploration of the Red Oil Palm Plantation with its extraction factory offer cultural insight into local life.With limited tourist infrastructure and eco-resorts blending into coastal shades, Little Andaman caters to off‑grid travelers seeking tranquility, adventure, and nature immersion.Accessibility includes ferry rides from Port Blair (6–9 hours) or a quicker 30–40 minute helicopter or sea-plane hop. The best travel window is November to April, when weather and sea conditions are ideal for exploration.

            <p style="font-size: 20px; background-color: #1f5c4b; color: white; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; border: 2px solid black;">
               Netrani Island—also known as Pigeon Island, Bajrangi, or Karnataka’s heart-shaped isle—is a small, uninhabited coral island about 19 km off Murudeshwar in coastal Uttara Kannada district.Only visible as a rocky outcrop from the mainland, it hosts wild goats, nesting pigeons, and the historic Bajrangbali Devasthana, where devotees offer mangoes and wall clocks to Lord Hanuman as part of ancient rituals tied to local folklore.Beneath its waves lies one of India’s finest scuba-diving destinations, with multiple dive sites—such as “The Nursery,” “Grand Central Station,” “Dini’s Delight,” and “Abyss”—offering visibility of 15–30 m and depths ranging from 6 m to around 35 m.The coral reefs teem with colorful reef fish, trigger and parrot fish, moray eels, jacks, reef sharks, turtles, and even occasional sightings of whale sharks or orcas.Diving is permitted only from licensed operators based in Murudeshwar—they organize boat transfers, gear, permits, and safety briefings. The best season for diving is October through May; monsoons make the sea rough and diving unsafe.At around 150 words, Netrani Island stands out as a serene yet thrilling marine destination—perfect for diving enthusiasts seeking vibrant reefs, rich biodiversity, and a dash of cultural mystery under Karnataka’s skies.
